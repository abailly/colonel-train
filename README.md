**THIS CODE DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE**

An experimental [clojure](http://clojure.org) application built over the great [capitainetrain](http://capitainetrain.com) train reservation site that leverages the API to list past tickets and print them as a single PDF. I built this application for two purposes:

* I needed a way to quickly report all travels in a month to ease accounting of my travel expenses,
* I wanted to learn more about how to do web development in the clojure eco-system.
